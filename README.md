# My-Excelerate-Campaign-Insights
During my internship at Excelerate, I worked in the role of a Data Analyst on a project for our partner GlobalShala. The Marketing team at GlobalShala needed help analyzing their Facebook ad campaign data for Superhero U, a global competition they organized.

The task: identify at least one campaign to discontinue in order to cut costs, while still maximizing engagement.

# ✨ Project Overview
The project involved:

Cleaning, modeling, and analyzing raw Facebook Ads Manager data.

Exploring ad performance across geographies, age groups, and demographics.

Identifying cost-inefficient campaigns.

Designing polished Power BI dashboards to present insights.

Creating a slide presentation to communicate recommendations to the Finance team.

The final deliverable was a recorded team presentation supported by dashboards and slides.

# 📄 Dataset Description
The dataset contained:

Campaign Information → Campaign ID, Name, Objective

Demographics → Age groups, Gender, Geography

Ad Performance → Impressions, Reach, Unique Link Clicks (ULC), Engagements
