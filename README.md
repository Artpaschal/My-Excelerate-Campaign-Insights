# My-Excelerate-Campaign-Insights
During my internship at Excelerate, I worked in the role of a Data Analyst on a project for our partner GlobalShala. The Marketing team at GlobalShala needed help analyzing their Facebook ad campaign data for Superhero U, a global competition they organized.

The task: identify at least one campaign to discontinue in order to cut costs, while still maximizing engagement.

# ✨ Project Overview
The project involved:

Cleaning, modeling, and analyzing raw Facebook Ads Manager data.

Exploring ad performance across geographies, age groups, and demographics.

Identifying cost-inefficient campaigns.

Designing polished Power BI dashboards to present insights.

Creating a slide presentation to communicate recommendations to the Finance team.

The final deliverable was a recorded team presentation supported by dashboards and slides.

# 📄 Dataset Description
The dataset contained:

Campaign Information → Campaign ID, Name, Objective

Demographics → Age groups, Gender, Geography

Ad Performance → Impressions, Reach, Unique Link Clicks (ULC), Engagements

Costs → Spend, Cost-per-Click (CPC), Cost-per-Result

# 🔍 Key Business Questions
✔️ Which campaigns drive the most unique link clicks and engagement?
✔️ Which geographies and age groups perform best in terms of ROI?
✔️ Are there campaigns that consistently cost more than they deliver?
✔️ What campaign should be recommended for discontinuation to reduce costs?

Including;
💡 Campaign Performance Summary

Top-performing Geographies

💸 Cost Efficiency Analysis

Campaigns ranked by Spend vs. Results

Identification of low ROI campaigns to discontinue

# 💬 Key Insights & Recommendation

Age 18–24 group delivered the highest engagement at the lowest cost.

Campaigns targeting Nigeria , and Group 2 together (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Taiwan) showed strong ROI compared to others.

Campaign 3 showed high spend but low unique link clicks, making it a candidate for discontinuation.

Recommended: reallocate budget from underperforming campaigns to high-performing demographics/geographies.
